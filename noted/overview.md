    #### File Type 

    * RDF/XML seems likely
    > xmls 

    ```xml vs rdf
    XML is a syntax while RDF is a data model

    RDF documents are written in XML. The XML language used by RDF is called RDF/XML. By using XML, RDF information can easily be exchanged between different types of computers using different types of operating systems and application languages.
    ```

    ```tei xml vs rdf xml
        TEI is an XML-based markup language that enable scholars to store, analyze, and share humanities textual information. The Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) Consortium is a organization that develops the standards for text encoding in the TEI encoding language.

        However, TEI is XML based, and thus it suffers heavy limitations, such as overlapping annotations. RDF is able to overcome this, using ontology vocabularies and allowing powerful queries.

        http://rdftef.sourceforge.net/
        RdfTef >> RDF Textual Encoding Framework
        is an open source Java framework that supports textual encoding in RDF+OWL. It provides a shell that allows the model to be queried using SPARQL, is able to import existing encoded text in XML TEI format, and can save the model to RDF/XML or export it in form of aspect slices, as XML TEI format.

    ```

    ```Sparql
    SPARQL (pronounced "sparkle" /ˈspɑːkəl/, a recursive acronym for SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is an RDF query language
    ```

    !dead resource > not all research can be public 
    who is the custodian of records // permission-ing
    > someone asks for access > determined by custodian > given identifier/key
        will they publish them? ethics?

    this project is created only in respect to publicly released materials
    technical solution
        point is to release something publicly > private resources are stored elsewhere

    ```

    #### Metadata Standards
    ```Dublin bb
    The Dublin Core™ is a set of fifteen basic categories (such as creator, title, subject, and publisher) for describing information resources (see http://dublincore.org/)

    https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmes-xml/

    ```

        ***
    make a maximalist record >> flesh out a template
    > then something that can parse it 
    (dot notation? item.title)
    provenance ---  item.ownership.3

    * [Creating Metadata](https://www.dublincore.org/resources/userguide/creating_metadata/)

    #### Coding Languages

    /// recursion to parse through nodes of arrays
        arrays & nodes >
    make xml parsable

    //end of the line boi
